Take a look to buildozer dependences:

(CYthon version ERROR)
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Cython (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for Cython [duplicate]
ERROR: No matching distribution found for Cython
SOL: 
buildozer android cleansudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
buildozer android clean
buildozer android debug deploy run

SOL2:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git zip unzip openjdk-8-jdk python3-pip autoconf libtool pkg-config zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libtinfo5 cmake libffi-dev libssl-dev
pip3 install --user --upgrade Cython==0.29.19 virtualenv 
# the --user should be removed if you do this in a venv

# add the following line at the end of your ~/.bashrc file
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/
SOL3:
If you did not install this (libssl-dev) buildozer dependency, initially and have already executed

buildozer android debug deploy run
just adding this dependency using

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
and running buildozer android debug deploy run will throw out the same error again. So execute this instead

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
buildozer android clean
Now you should be good to go.

When debuggin and deploying app:
  Module not found: idna
  you need either charset normalizer or chardet  
Include in the dependencies those modules
